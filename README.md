# Red, Green, Refactor

A very simple calculator designed to teach software testing.

The majority of the reference implementaiton is inspired by [Ruslan Spivak]'s
_[Let's Build a Simple Interpreter]_ project.

## Saved by the test
Certain sections of this tutorial have been labelled as
```
Saved by the test
```
These denote places in the code where the presence of tests saved the authors
from undue headache. They have been preserved as a reminder that _everyone_
makes mistakes and that tests are here to help. :wink:

## Rabbit hole
Certain sections of this tutorial have been labelled as
```
Rabbit hole
```
These denote places in the code where the authors tried to anticipate questions
or concerns that folks who are new to Python might have, but that may not get
covered in detail. Hopefully these comments will elucidate some of the more
confusing parts in this tutorial. If not, feel free to ask questions! :smile:

## Notes:
- This code has was written and tested against Python 3.4 and 3.5.
