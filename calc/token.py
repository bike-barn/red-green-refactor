class Token:
    """
    A calculator token used to represent the current state of the calculator.

    Note:
        There is no verification of valid tokens at this point. Later versions
        of this class should verify correct input parameters.

    Args:
        type (str): The type of token. Valid types are currently ``INTEGER``,
            ``PLUS``, and ``EOF``.
        value (:obj:`int` or :obj:`str`): The value of the token. Valid values
            are currently non-negative integers, or the ``+`` operator.

    Attributes:
        type (str): The type of token. Valid types are currently ``INTEGER``,
            ``PLUS``, and ``EOF``.
        value (:obj:`int` or :obj:`str`): The value of the token. Valid values
            are currently non-negative integers, or the ``+`` operator.

    Rabbit hole:
        The ``type`` keyword is a reserved word in Python. It is typically bad
        practice to create a new variable that overrides a reserved word, but
        it is useful in this context and the scope is limited, so we take
        advantage of that here.
