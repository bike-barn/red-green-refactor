# Rabbit hole: This pattern below is a Python idiom that basically says, if this
# module (this file) is being run as the main program (i.e. it was invoked from
# the command line as python __main__.py, then run the main() function. In
# practice this means that this module can be imported without actually running
# the main() function, but that main() will be run if that is the intention.
